Community-curated list of software packages and data resources for Glycoscience [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/amanzadi/awesome-glyco/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This collection is inspired by [awesome-single-cell](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell).


**Recommended** label lists my favorites -- they only reflect my personal reference and are not rigorously evaluated. Contact me if you would like other software to be added!

## Software packages
- [Glycowork](GlyCosmos) - [python] - Glycowork is a Python package specifically designed to simplify glycan sequence processing and analysis.
- [CandyCrunch](https://github.com/BojarLab/CandyCrunch) - [python] - CandyCrunch is a package for predicting glycan structure from LC-MS/MS data. It contains the CandyCrunch model, along with the rest of the inference pipeline and downstream spectrum processing tools.

## Web portals and databases
- [GlyCosmos](https://glycosmos.org/) - [webportal] - A web portal aiming to integrate glycosciences with the life sciences. It consists of Standards, Repositories, and Data Resources, providing information about genes, proteins, lipids, pathways, and diseases. **Recommended**
- [GlyGen](https://www.glygen.org/) - [webportal] -A data integration and dissemination project for carbohydrate and glycoconjugate-related data. GlyGen retrieves information from multiple international data sources and integrates and harmonizes this data.**Recommended**
- [Glyco3D](https://glyco3d.cermav.cnrs.fr/) - [webportal] - Glyco3D is a portal of databases covering the three-dimensional features of monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides (Conformations and NMR spectra), polysaccharides, glycosyltransferases, lectins, monoclonal antibodies against carbohydrates, and glycosaminoglycan binding proteins.

## Interactive visualization and analysis
- [GlyConnect Compozitor](https://glyconnect.expasy.org/compozitor/) - [webserver] -Visualises glycan compositions as a network of relations of shared monosaccharides Outputs interactive graphs summarising information searched in the GlyConnect database.
